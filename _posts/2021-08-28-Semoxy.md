title: "Semoxy - a Web interface for Minecraft Servers"
author: Anton Vogelsang
---

A friend of mine and me recently set up an old computer with Linux for running our own Minecraft server.
Since it would be hard for him to control this server, I decided to write a Web-Application for more comfort.

The Backend is written in **Python**, because it's my main language, and it has the `subprocess` module which makes it easy to run the servers.  
As a Database I, chose **MongoDB**, because I have never done something with it.  
The frontend is a **ReactJS** Application, because I wanted to get more familiar with the framework.

This is how the web interface currently looks like:

It has already responsive design, login and fetches all required data.

## Features
### User and Permission Management
Of course, a server has to be secured. That's why you can only use Semoxy with an account.
The first account will be created with a temporary token that is stored in the file system by the server.
After that, other users can be added using the existing accounts.

Each user can be given permissions that restrict them in what they can do to your servers.
For example, there will be permissions for viewing a server, starting a server and modifying the settings of a server.

### Server Start / Stop
The interface offers simple buttons to start and stop the server with one click.

### Remote access to server console
View the server console in real-time and issue commands.
You can also deny the execution of certain commands via permissions.

### Creation of servers with preset software
This is my design for the Server creation:

As you can see, you can select the software, specific subversions and the amount of memory to be allocated to the server.

### Backups
You can set a time interval and Semoxy will automatically create the backups.
It'll give you the possibility to load only specific chunks of the world.
This way, progress in other chunks isn't lost when a backup is restored.
The predecessor of this was my project [FlexBackup]({% post_url 2021-08-28-Flexible-Minecraft-Backups %}).

### Dynamic Server Management
When this feature is enabled, servers are automatically started when players try to connect and stopped when no one
is playing. This is useful if you want to run multiple servers with only one or no players at a time
on a low-end server.

### Mods and Plugins
Mods and Plugins can be installed on the server with just one click.
Semoxy uses the Curseforge-API to provide information about Mods and Plugins,
and you can even create modpack servers.

## Progress
At the moment, the backend also supports a plenty of features like server starting, login and events (console).
This project is originated from [MCWeb](https://github.com/xImAnton/mcweb), which I decided to rewrite because of bad code.
At the moment, I'm mainly working on the frontend.
