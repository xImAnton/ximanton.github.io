So I recently have been working myself into AVR Development with C and I had these 4x4 LED Matrices lying around
since a few years ago. So why not combine all of this?

## Shift registers
We could connect each of the 16 LEDs to a pin on the ATmega, but this would occupy almost all
pins it has. In theory, this would be possible, but I want to scale up later and use 2 or 3 of the 16-LED matrices
with one controller which would be 48 LEDs. That are definitely too many for an ATmega8, which only has 28
pins in total. So we got to come up with another solution for connecting the LEDs.
Now, shift registers come into play.

Shift registers are like external (1-byte) storages. There are two types of shift registers:
parallel and serial ones. For this project, we only care about serial ones, because these can be set using 2 wires:  
The `DATA` line is used to transfer single bits to the register. Once the `CLOCK` signal is toggled high,
the register shifts every bit one bit to the right and inserts the current state of the `DATA` line
on the left. Every one of the 8 bits can be read via the terminals of the shift register (`Q1`, `Q2`, ...).

For this project, I'm using the `CD4094B` registers, a quick look at the
[datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4094b.pdf) gives us this pin assignment schematic:
![CD4094B pin layout](/assets/img/posts/CD4094B_layout.png)

I wrote a small [library](https://github.com/xImAnton/avrstuff/blob/main/include/libshift.h) for dealing with these registers.
You can set them up like this:

```c
shift_register_t shift = {
    SR_SIZE_8
    .ddr = &DDRC,
    .port = &PORTC,
    .clock = PC4,
    .data = PC5,
    .use_strobe = 0
};

sr_setup(&shift);
```

`ddr` is the data direction register for setting up the pin outputs,
`port` is the port which is used to set the actual output,
`clock` is the pin connected to the CLOCK pin of the shift register.
`data` is the pin of the data line and
`size` is the amount of bits the shift register can store, 8 in our case.

"Strobe" is a functionality of the shift registers, that hides changes to the bits until a specific
pin has a specific state. Although this could be helpful with avoiding quick flickering of the LEDs when
changing the state, we don't use it for this project, since it would occupy an additional pin on the controller.

To set the byte in the shift register, you can use `sr_set`:

```c
sr_set(&shift, 0b10101010);
```

This sets the `DATA` pin accordingly to every bit in the byte and uses `sr_shift()` which shifts the
register value one bit to the left by toggling the `CLOCK` pin.

For testing this, I hooked up an LED to each pin out of the shift register and displayed (moving) patterns.
This it what it looked like, basically the lit LED rotates in the circle, and you can control the speed using the two buttons.

The code and circuit diagram is [here on github](https://github.com/xImAnton/avrstuff/tree/main/led_rotation_speed).
I recommend checking this out to better understand the functionality in combination with the code.

## Wiring
[This](https://www.pollin.de/productdownloads/D120748D.PDF) is the datasheet for the matrices.  
The LEDs are double colored (red and green) but I'm only using the red ones for now.  
They got a common anode, which means we need to connect the anodes to 5V and the cathodes to the
outputs of the shift register.
I connected the LEDs to the output pins of the two shift registers and connected their important lines to the ATmega

*I'm not going to get further into the details of the construction. If you need help building this yourself, contact me on [discord](./#contact) ;)*

After I assembled it on a breadboard, this is what it looks like:

*I apologize, that the image is not very helpful. I haven't made a good photo when I had this built up.*

## Matrix Abstraction
For controlling the matrices we are using a struct that can be set up like this:
```c
ledm_t matrix = {
    .shift1 = &shift1,
    .shift2 = &shift2,
    .common_cathode = 0
};
```

For storing the display state of a matrix, we could just use a 16-bit integer, since our matrices are 4x4.
And this is exactly what I did. The method for setting the 16 LEDs to a given figure looks is implemented very simple:
```c
void ledm_set(ledm_t *matrix, ledm_letter_t l) {
    sr_set(matrix->shift1, l & 0xFF); // set first register to first byte of the integer
    sr_set(matrix->shift2, l >> 8);   // set second register to second byte of the integer
}
```

***Note***: `ledm_letter_t` is just a type alias for `uint16_t`, a 16-bit unsigned integer. I call all
16-bit configurations for these matrices "letters" in this project.

**So now we can set our matrix to random patterns! Yay**

## Adding Letters
For easier definition of the letters, I created simple bit flags for each LED. These are numbered A1-D4:
```c
#define LEDM_A1 0x1
#define LEDM_A2 0x2
#define LEDM_A3 0x4
#define LEDM_A4 0x8
#define LEDM_B1 0x10
#define LEDM_B2 0x20
#define LEDM_B3 0x40
#define LEDM_B4 0x80
#define LEDM_C1 0x100
#define LEDM_C2 0x200
#define LEDM_C3 0x400
#define LEDM_C4 0x800
#define LEDM_D1 0x1000
#define LEDM_D2 0x2000
#define LEDM_D3 0x4000
#define LEDM_D4 0x8000
```

When we now want to define a letter, we can just `OR` together these flags. For example
```c
ledm_set(&matrix, LEDM_A1 | LEDM_B1 | LEDM_C1 | LEDM_D1);
```
would show an "I" by lighting up the first row of the matrix.

Since I was too lazy to do that all by hand, I created an [html page](matrix_utils.html) for generating letters
using checkboxes.

Using this I created letters for, well letters, digits, some punctuation marks and some arithmetic symbols.
With some letters I had to go with the lowercase variant, since the uppercase wouldn't have fit in the 4x4 grid.

## Displaying Words
At this point, there isn't much magic about writing a method that takes in an array of letters and displays them
back to back on the matrix.

At first, we create an array for testing:
```c
ledm_letter_t helloworld[] = {LEDM_H, LEDM_E, LEDM_L, LEDM_L, LEDM_O, LEDM_COMMA, LEDM_SPACE, LEDM_W, LEDM_O, LEDM_R, LEDM_L, LEDM_D, LEDM_EXCLAMATION, LEDM_SPACE}; // HELLO, WORLD!
```
And because writing these words is also very stressful, there is also a generator for that on the [tool page](matrix_utils.html).

Now we just have to loop over this array and display them with a short delay:
```c
void ledm_show_word(ledm_t *matrix, ledm_letter_t letters[], uint32_t word_size) {
    uint32_t letter_count = word_size / sizeof(ledm_letter_t);
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < letter_count; i++) {
        ledm_set(matrix, letters[i]);
        delay(500); // time to read the letter
        ledm_clear(matrix); // short time without light
        delay(50);
    }
}

ledm_show_word(&matrix, helloworld, sizeof(helloworld));
```

__With this code, we can now display static texts on our *high resolution* screen!__
