title: "Semoxy - a Webinterface for Minecraft Servers"
---

I and my friend recently set up an old computer with linux to run a minecraft server.
I would have been completely fine with controlling the server via ssh, but he wasn't,
so I decided to write a Web-Application for controlling the server more easily. 

**Disclaimer: The Project isn't finished yet**

The Backend is written in Python, because it's my main language, and it has the `subprocess` module which makes it easy to run the servers.
As a Database I chose MongoDB, because I have never done something with it.
The frontend is a ReactJS Application, because I wanted to get more familiar with the framework.
