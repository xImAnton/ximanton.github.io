title: "Rewrite of my Website"

In early 2021 I created my first homepage with NextJS.
It only consisted of a landing page and contained information about
my projects directly on it. At first, this seemed like a good idea
to get a broad overview, but I realized that this isn't very expandable.

At the same time, I wanted to write more specifically about my projects.
After a quick google search I found Jekyll, a static site generator made for blogs,
and it seemed perfect for my needs.

For first testing and familiarization, I looked for nice and small themes and found
[Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale/).
I liked the design, so I used it as a base for my own blog design that I created using Figma.
The landing page is also based on my old homepage. For the waves in the background, I used
[this tool](https://www.shapedivider.app/) I saw in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPJVi797Uy0).

Because I no longer had to show the projects on the start page, I dedicated a section to the tools
I'm familiar with.

Now I'm trying to write frequently about my projects.
Let's see if I can manage.
